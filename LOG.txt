2026-01-23 22:46 - Fix GPT-5 temperature handling and stabilize UX smoke run
- Issues: OpenAI responses API rejected temperature for GPT-5.* (fixed by disabling temp + server-side normalization)
- Changes: backend/config.py (GPT-5 temp disabled), backend/services/model_catalog.py (infer temp unsupported for GPT-5), backend/services/llm_client.py (normalize temperature), backend/tests/test_config.py (assert GPT-5 temp disabled)
- Tests: `cd backend && uv run ruff format .`, `cd backend && uv run ruff check .`, `cd backend && uvx ty check`, `cd backend && uv run pytest` (multiple passes); `cd frontend && npm run build` (multiple passes); `node scripts/api-smoke.js`, `node scripts/image-smoke.js`, `node scripts/ux-smoke.js`, `node scripts/ux-extended.js`, `node scripts/ux-matrix.js`, `node scripts/ux-manual.js` (with `PLAYWRIGHT_HOST_PLATFORM_OVERRIDE=mac14-arm64`)
- Notes: ran backend/ frontend dev servers for smoke/UX; Playwright browsers already installed

2026-01-23 21:30 - Run full checks loop, document permissions, add backend unit tests
- Issues: Smoke tests blocked (backend/frontend not running; image-smoke needs API keys); Playwright browsers missing before install (installed via `npx playwright install`)
- Changes: AGENTS.md (permissions/approvals notes), README.md (updated test commands + sandbox note), SPEC.md (testing status), backend/pyproject.toml (pytest dev dep + pytest pythonpath), backend/tests/test_system_prompt.py, backend/tests/test_config.py
- Tests: `cd backend && uv run ruff format .`, `cd backend && uv run ruff check .`, `cd backend && uvx ty check`, `cd backend && uv run pytest` (3x); `cd frontend && npm run build` (3x); smoke scripts `node scripts/api-smoke.js`, `node scripts/image-smoke.js`, `node scripts/ux-smoke.js`, `node scripts/ux-extended.js`, `node scripts/ux-matrix.js`, `node scripts/ux-manual.js` failed (backend/frontend not running, missing Playwright before install)
- Notes: `git commit --dry-run -am "chore: checks"` only; Playwright installed in `~/Library/Caches/ms-playwright`

2026-01-23 20:33 - Expand AGENTS.md with continuous testing and refinement loop requirements
- Issues: not queried (doc-only update)
- Changes: AGENTS.md (continuous lint/format/tests/build, completion test gate, 3x refinement loop, autonomy expectations)
- Tests: not run (doc-only change)
- Notes: new policy requires repeated refinement + re-testing unless explicitly waived
